Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using any part of the Websites or self-managed installations, you acknowledge you have been informed of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.\n\n\n\n<h2 class='\"wp-block-heading\"' id='\"data-protection\"'><a href='\"https:\/\/www.chatwoot.com\/privacy-policy\/#data-protection\"' rel='\"noopener\"' target='\"_blank\"'>Data Protection\n\n\n\n<p>Oversight of Data Security is handled by Chatwoot&#8217;s respective Data Protection Officers. Should you wish to make modifications, deletions, or additions to any personal data you believe to be captured by Chatwoot, or if you have any general security concerns, please contact us at privacy@chatwoot.com\n\n\n\n<h2 class='\"wp-block-heading\"' id='\"what-information-chatwoot-collects-and-why\"'><a href='\"https:\/\/www.chatwoot.com\/privacy-policy\/#what-information-chatwoot-collects-and-why\"' rel='\"noopener\"' target='\"_blank\"'>What Information Chatwoot Collects and Why\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Information from Website Visitors\n\n\n\n<p>Like most website operators, Chatwoot collects basic non-personally-identifying information from Website visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect this information to better understand how visitors use the Website, to improve our Websites and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of the Websites. From time to time, Chatwoot may publicly release non-personally-identifying information collected from Website visitors in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.\n\n\n\n<p>Chatwoot also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from visitors. Chatwoot does not use such information to identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this information to understand how visitors use the Websites, to improve performance and content, and to monitor the security of the Websites.\n\n\n\n<p>Chatwoot may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites. For instance, Chatwoot may reveal how many downloads a particular version got using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous user information only.\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Usage Data Information from Self-managed Chatwoot Instances\n\n\n\n<p>Chatwoot collects information about usage from each self-managed Chatwoot instance (Community Edition and Enterprise Edition). We do not track your end users, but tracks the usage of these instances at an aggregate level &#8211; it is also possible to disable sending this using the environment toggle in the application.\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personally-Identifying Information\n\n\n\n<p>Users of the Websites may choose to interact with Chatwoot in ways that provide us with their personally-identifying information. In some instances, a User ID is generated for form and url tracking, page views, page pings and usage counts in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type of information that Chatwoot gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share. For example, we ask visitors who use our live-chat widget to provide full name and email address. We will also collect the information you provide with us in connection with creating an account on the Website.\n\n\n\n<p>If you report a security vulnerability to Chatwoot and request public acknowledgement, then we may publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in connection with the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgement. In each case, Chatwoot collects such personally-identifiable information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with or request of Chatwoot. We will not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain Website-related activities or being able to access and use certain features and services. For details about what information is collected and with whom it is shared, please refer tracking technologies.\n\n\n\n<h2 class='\"wp-block-heading\"' id='\"information-chatwoot-does-not-collect\"'><a href='\"https:\/\/www.chatwoot.com\/privacy-policy\/#information-chatwoot-does-not-collect\"' rel='\"noopener\"' target='\"_blank\"'><strong>Information Chatwoot Does Not Collect\n\n\n\n<p>Chatwoot does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Chatwoot does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information in a Chatwoot instance by pushing it to us through our live-chat, our libraries or API. If you store any sensitive personal information on Chatwoot servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the United States.\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the Website. Chatwoot does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our Website or content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits. If you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Chatwoot.\n\n\n\n<h2 class='\"wp-block-heading\"' id='\"basis-for-processing-your-information\"'><a href='\"https:\/\/www.chatwoot.com\/privacy-policy\/#basis-for-processing-your-information\"' rel='\"noopener\"' target='\"_blank\"'>Basis for Processing Your Information\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance of a contract:The use of your information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with us.

Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Chatwoot discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Chatwoot believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Chatwoot, third parties, or the public at large.\n\n\n\n<p>Chatwoot takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.\n\n\n\n<p>Chatwoot at its sole discretion may make use of company logos where those companies are using the software that we provide. If you have concerns over the use of your logo, please email hello@chatwoot.com.\n\n\n\n<p><strong>International Transfer of Information\n\n\n\n<p>The Website is hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that process information for us as described above may be located in the United States, India or in other countries outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the international transfer of your information by Chatwoot.\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chatwoot Communications with You\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a registered user of the Websites and have supplied your email address, Chatwoot may occasionally send you an email to tell you about security, system information, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&#8217;s going on with Chatwoot and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. There&#8217;s an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you so you can stop receiving such emails at any time.\n\n\n\n<p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We will not publish your personally-identifiable information in connection with your request.\n\n\n\n<h2 class='\"wp-block-heading\"' id='\"cookies-tracking-technologies-and-do-not-track\"'><a href='\"https:\/\/www.chatwoot.com\/privacy-policy\/#cookies-tracking-technologies-and-do-not-track\"' rel='\"noopener\"' target='\"_blank\"'><strong>Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Do Not Track\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cookies\n\n\n\n<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&#8217;s computer, and that the visitor&#8217;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Chatwoot uses cookies to identify and track visitors, their usage of the Websites, and their Website access preferences. Chatwoot visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Websites. Disabling browser cookies may cause certain features of Chatwoot&#8217;s websites to not function properly. Certain pages on the Website may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These sites set their own cookies and we do not have access or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tracking Technologies\n\n\n\n<p>We may use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to track you individually or collect your personally identifiable-information. We may use these services to collect information about how the Website performs and how users navigate through and use the Website so we can monitor and improve our content and Website performance. Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your use of the Website. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do Not Track\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. Chatwoot does not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser&#8217;s Do Not Track setting.\n\n\n\n<h2 class='\"wp-block-heading\"' id='\"global-privacy-practices\"'><a href='\"https:\/\/www.chatwoot.com\/privacy-policy\/#global-privacy-practices\"' rel='\"noopener\"' target='\"_blank\"'>Global Privacy Practices\n\n\n\n<p>Information we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy but we understand that users from other countries may have different expectations and rights with regard to their privacy.
